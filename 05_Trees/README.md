# 05 — Trees

## Overview
This module introduces **Tree data structures**, which organize data hierarchically and enable efficient searching, insertion, deletion, and traversal.

Trees are foundational in:
- Decision Trees and Random Forests  
- Search and indexing systems  
- Hierarchical data representation  
- Optimization and routing algorithms  

A deep understanding of trees is essential for becoming a **strong ML engineer and system designer**.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this module, you will be able to:
- Understand hierarchical data representation using trees  
- Implement different types of trees and their operations  
- Perform recursive and iterative tree traversals  
- Analyze time and space complexity of tree-based algorithms  
- Apply tree structures to ML models and large-scale systems

## Contents
This folder covers the following topics:

- **Binary Tree**  
  Basic tree structure with at most two children per node.

- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**  
  Ordered binary tree that enables efficient searching and sorting.

- **AVL Tree**  
  Self-balancing binary search tree that maintains height balance.

- **Segment Tree**  
  Tree structure for efficient range queries and updates.

- **Trie (Prefix Tree)**  
  Specialized tree for storing strings and performing fast prefix searches.

- **Code Examples**  
  Practical Python implementations with sample outputs.

## Why This Matters for Machine Learning
Trees are directly used in many ML algorithms and systems:

- Decision Trees and ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- Feature selection and hierarchical clustering  
- Fast indexing of large datasets  
- Autocomplete and NLP prefix matching using Tries  
- Efficient range queries in data preprocessing  

Mastering trees allows ML engineers to:
- Build interpretable models  
- Optimize data access  
- Design scalable training pipelines  

Trees form the **bridge between classical algorithms and modern ML systems**.

## Expected Prerequisites
Before starting this module, you should be comfortable with:
- Recursion and stack behavior  
- Linked lists and queues  
- Time and space complexity  
- Basic graph and hierarchical thinking  

This module heavily relies on **recursive problem solving**.
