# 04 — Stacks and Queues

## Overview
This module introduces **Stacks and Queues**, two fundamental linear data structures that control how data is accessed, stored, and processed.

Stacks and queues form the backbone of:
- Function calls and recursion
- Scheduling systems
- Graph and tree traversals
- Real-time data processing pipelines used in machine learning systems

A strong understanding of these structures is essential for building **efficient, scalable ML and software systems**.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this module, you will be able to:
- Understand LIFO and FIFO processing models
- Implement stacks and queues using arrays and linked lists
- Analyze time and space complexity of stack and queue operations
- Apply these structures to algorithmic and system-level problems

---

## Contents
This folder covers the following topics:

- **Stack**  
  Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structure used in recursion, expression evaluation, and backtracking.

- **Queue**  
  First-In-First-Out (FIFO) structure used in scheduling, buffering, and breadth-first search.

- **Priority Queue**  
  Queue where elements are processed based on priority rather than insertion order.

- **Code Examples**  
  Practical Python implementations with sample outputs.

## Why This Matters for Machine Learning
Stacks and queues play a critical role in ML systems and data pipelines:

- Managing mini-batch processing
- Implementing BFS in graph-based models
- Scheduling training jobs and inference requests
- Handling streaming and buffered data
- Supporting backtracking in optimization algorithms

Understanding these structures improves:
- System efficiency  
- Memory management  
- Model pipeline reliability  

They help bridge the gap between **algorithm design and production ML systems**.

## Expected Prerequisites
Before starting this module, you should be comfortable with:
- Basic programming concepts  
- Arrays and linked lists  
- Time and space complexity  

This module builds directly on previous DSA foundations.

---

## How to Use This Module
1. Study the concept files in the given order  
2. Visualize each structure and its operations  
3. Run and modify the provided Python examples  
4. Analyze complexity for every operation  

Focus not only on *how* they work, but *why* each structure is used.

---

## What’s Next
After completing this section, continue with:
- **05_Trees**, where hierarchical data structures and recursive algorithms become central.
