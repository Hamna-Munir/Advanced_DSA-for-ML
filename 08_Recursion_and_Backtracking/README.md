# Recursion and Backtracking — Data Structures & Algorithms

## Overview
This module introduces **recursion** and **backtracking**, two powerful problem-solving techniques used to break complex problems into smaller, manageable subproblems.

These concepts are essential for building strong algorithmic intuition and are widely used in advanced computing tasks, including optimization problems, search algorithms, and machine learning workflows.

Understanding recursion and backtracking strengthens logical reasoning and prepares learners for more advanced algorithm design.
