# Hashing and Sets — Data Structures & Algorithms

## Overview
This module introduces **hash-based data structures**, which enable extremely fast data lookup, storage, and retrieval.

Hashing is a foundational concept behind many high-performance systems and is widely used in machine learning pipelines, large-scale data processing, and real-time applications.

This section focuses on understanding how hashing works, how hash maps and sets are implemented, and how they improve algorithm efficiency.
