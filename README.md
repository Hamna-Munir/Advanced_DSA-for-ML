# DSA-for-ML

##  Overview
Welcome to **DSA-for-ML**, a comprehensive repository designed to teach **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** with a focus on **Machine Learning applications**.  
This repository is structured to help beginners and intermediate learners understand algorithms, implement them in code, and see how they can be applied in AI/ML workflows.

---

##  Goals
- Build a strong foundation in **DSA**.
- Learn **code implementation** for all major data structures and algorithms.
- Understand the **time and space complexity** of algorithms.
- Apply DSA concepts to **real-world ML problems**.
- Create a **portfolio-ready project repository**.
